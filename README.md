CRC Subtyping Consortium
=====

The colorectal subtyping consortium was formed to build consensus on the molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer (CRC) among the major researchers and clinicians in this field.  The consortium members have agreed to contribute and share their respective data sets to achieve the following goals:
  1. to compare and validate the major published colorectal subtypes;
  2. to conduct an integrative analysis across the pooled data sets to establish a robust consensus of molecular subtypes;
  3. to define the clinical and molecular hallmarks of these subtypes;
  4. to investigate the clinical value of these subtypes in patient studies; and
  5. to establish a new paradigm within the research community based on collaboration and sharing when defining subtypes in cancer.
